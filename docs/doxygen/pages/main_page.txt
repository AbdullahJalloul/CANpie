** \mainpage    %CANpie<sup>FD</sup> Documentation

The goal of this project is to define a standard Application Programming 
Interface (API) for access to the CAN bus. The \ref page.api provides 
functionality for ISO/OSI Layer-2 (Data Link Layer). It is not the intention 
of %CANpie<sup>FD</sup> to incorporate higher layer functionality (e.g. 
CANopen, J1939). The \ref page.api covers support for classic CAN frames as 
well as for ISO CAN FD frames. 

Where ever it is possible %CANpie<sup>FD</sup> is independent from the used 
hardware and operating system. The function calls are unique for different 
kinds of hardware. 
Also %CANpie<sup>FD</sup> provides a method to gather information about the 
features of the CAN hardware. This is especially important for an application 
designer, who wants to write the code only once.

The API is designed for embedded control applications as well as for PC 
interface boards.

<h2>Compatibilty</h2>
The C language API of %CANpie<sup>FD</sup> is compatible to 
<a href="http://canpie.sourceforge.net">CANpie Version 2</a>,

<h2>%CANpie File structure</h2>


<h2>%CANpie configuration options</h2>
